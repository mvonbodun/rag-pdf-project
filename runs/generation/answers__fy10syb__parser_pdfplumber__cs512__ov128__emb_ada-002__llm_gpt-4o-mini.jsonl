Aliens request\nasylum if they fear harm if returned to their native country or if they have suffered harm\nin the past. To be granted asylum, an alien must demonstrate past persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution based on the alien’s race, religion, nationality, political\nbeliefs, and/or membership in a particular social group.\nThere are two ways that aliens may request asylum: “affirmatively,” by\ncompleting an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office; or\n“defensively,” by requesting asylum before an immigration judge. Aliens who file\naffirmatively with DHS, but whose requests for asylum are not granted, may be placed\nin removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for further\nreview of the case.\nFigure 13\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative and Defensive\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nAffirmative Defensive\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative Defensive Total\nFY 06 37,294 19,675 56,969\nFY 07 41,214 16,301 57,515\nFY 08 32,776 14,666 47,442\nFY 09 29,897 14,125 44,022\nFY 10 24,372 8,589 32,961\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book I1 January 2011 \n\n\n\n\n\n", "token_count": 490}, {"chunk_id": 59, "text": "\n17.09%\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book F1 January 2011Representation in Immigration Courts\t\t\t\n\tRepresented\tUnrepresented\tTotal\nFY 06\t114,684\t209,356\t324,040\nFY 07\t117,186\t156,282\t273,468\nFY 08\t113,169\t168,047\t281,216\nFY 09\t114,829\t175,606\t290,435\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n43% 40% 40%\n35%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t43%\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Immigration Courts:\nProceedings Completed by Representation Status\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act states that individuals in removal proceedings\nbefore an immigration judge may be represented by counsel, but at no expense to the\ngovernment. Prior to representing an alien before the immigration court, representatives\nmust file a Notice of Appearance with the court.\nMany individuals in removal proceedings are indigent and cannot afford a private\nattorney. Some seek free or pro bono representation, while others proceed without\ncounsel on their own, or pro se. Of great concern to EOIR is the large number of\nindividuals appearing pro se. Immigration judges, in order to ensure that such individuals\nunderstand the nature of the proceedings, as well as their rights and responsibilities, must\ntake extra care and spend additional time explaining this information. An individual may\nask for a continuance of a proceeding to obtain counsel.\nAs shown in Figure 9, less than half of the aliens whose proceedings were\ncompleted during the period FY 2006 – FY 2010 were represented. The percentage of\nrepresented aliens for FY 2006 to FY 2010 ranged from 35 percent to 43 percent.\nFigure 9\nCourt Proceedings Completed\nPercentage of Represented Cases\nRepresentation in Immigration Courts\nRepresented Unrepresented Total\n100% FY 06 114,684 209,356 324,040\nFY 07 117,186 156,282 273,468\n80%\nFY 08 113,169 168,047 281,216\nFY 09 114,829 175,606 290,435\n60%\n43% 40% 40% 43% FY 10 122,465 164,742 287,207\n35%\n40%\n20%\n0%\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book G1 January 2011", "token_count": 541}, {"chunk_id": 80, "text": "457 34%\n80% FY 07 4,426 6,921 39%\nFY 08 3,520 6,116 37%\n60%\n39% 37% 36% 35% FY 09 3,030 5,394 36%\n40% 34%\nFY 10 2,771 5,046 35%\n20%\n0%\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book January 2011\nK2 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Asylum Completions by Disposition\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tGrants\tDenials\tWithdrawn\tAbandoned\tOther\tTotal\nFY 06\t13,304\t16,477\t10,324\t3,918\t13,841\t57,864\nFY 07\t12,859\t14,874\t8,405\t3,985\t15,639\t55,762\nFY 08\t10,881\t13,167\t7,676\t3,449\t11,008\t46,181\nFY 09\t10,298\t11,334\t7,264\t3,406\t12,366\t44,668\nFY 10\t9,869\t9,554\t7,194\t1,799\t12,129\t40,545", "token_count": 322}], "generated_answer": "The purpose of the Statistical Year Book prepared by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is to serve as a public service and provide strictly informational content.

Aliens request\nasylum if they fear harm if returned to their native country or if they have suffered harm\nin the past. To be granted asylum, an alien must demonstrate past persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution based on the alien’s race, religion, nationality, political\nbeliefs, and/or membership in a particular social group.\nThere are two ways that aliens may request asylum: “affirmatively,” by\ncompleting an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office; or\n“defensively,” by requesting asylum before an immigration judge. Aliens who file\naffirmatively with DHS, but whose requests for asylum are not granted, may be placed\nin removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for further\nreview of the case.\nFigure 13\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative and Defensive\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nAffirmative Defensive\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative Defensive Total\nFY 06 37,294 19,675 56,969\nFY 07 41,214 16,301 57,515\nFY 08 32,776 14,666 47,442\nFY 09 29,897 14,125 44,022\nFY 10 24,372 8,589 32,961\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book I1 January 2011 \n\n\n\n\n\n", "token_count": 490}, {"chunk_id": 103, "text": "11 on page N2 shows the number and percentage of proceedings\ncompleted with applications for relief at each immigration court in FY 2010.

Aliens request\nasylum if they fear harm if returned to their native country or if they have suffered harm\nin the past. To be granted asylum, an alien must demonstrate past persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution based on the alien’s race, religion, nationality, political\nbeliefs, and/or membership in a particular social group.\nThere are two ways that aliens may request asylum: “affirmatively,” by\ncompleting an asylum application and filing it with a DHS Asylum Office; or\n“defensively,” by requesting asylum before an immigration judge. Aliens who file\naffirmatively with DHS, but whose requests for asylum are not granted, may be placed\nin removal proceedings and referred to the appropriate immigration court for further\nreview of the case.\nFigure 13\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative and Defensive\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nAffirmative Defensive\nImmigration Court Asylum Receipts\nAffirmative Defensive Total\nFY 06 37,294 19,675 56,969\nFY 07 41,214 16,301 57,515\nFY 08 32,776 14,666 47,442\nFY 09 29,897 14,125 44,022\nFY 10 24,372 8,589 32,961\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book I1 January 2011 \n\n\n\n\n\n", "token_count": 490}], "generated_answer": "The Statistical Year Book provides information that is strictly informational in nature and should not be regarded as legal advice or authority.

Unpublished decisions\nof the BIA are binding on the immigration judge or DHS with regard to the individual\ncase at issue unless overruled or modified by the Attorney General or a federal court.\nThe majority of cases reviewed by the BIA involve decisions made by\nimmigration judges in removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings, and for the\npurposes of this Statistical Year Book are referred to as immigration judge appeals.\nThese appeals are filed directly with the BIA in Falls Church, VA, and must be filed\nwithin 30 days of the immigration judge’s decision.\nOther types of cases over which the BIA has jurisdiction include appeals of\ncertain DHS decisions involving (1) family-based visa petitions adjudicated by DHS\nofficials; (2) fines and penalties imposed upon carriers for violations of immigration laws;\nand (3) waivers of inadmissibility for non-immigrants under §212(d)(3) of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act. For the purposes of this Statistical Year Book, appeals\nfrom these DHS decisions are referred to as DHS decision appeals.\nAs shown in Figure 25, BIA case receipts decreased by 17 percent from FY 2006\nto FY 2009. During this same period, case completions decreased by 20 percent.\nReceipts increased from FY 2009 to FY 2010 while completions remained about the\nsame.\nFigure 25\nTotal BIA Cases\nReceived and Completed\nTotal BIA Cases\nReceipts Completions\n50,000\n45,000 FY 06 39,743 41,475\n40,000 FY 07 36,606 35,394\n35,000 FY 08 33,469 38,369\n30,000\nFY 09 32,891 33,102\n25,000\nFY 10 35,787 33,305\nFY 06 FY 07 FY 08 FY 09 FY 10\nReceipts Completions\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology\nFY 2010 Statistical Year Book S1 January 2011", "token_count": 635}, {"chunk_id": 0, "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\nFY 2010\nStatistical Year Book\nPrepared by the Office of Planning, Analysis, & Technology\nJanuary 2011\nContact Information\nOffice of Legislative and Public Affairs\n5107 Leesburg Pike, Suite 1902\nFalls Church, VA 22041\n(703) 305-0289\n(703) 605-0365 (fax)\nDISCLAIMER\nThe Statistical Year Book has been prepared as a public service by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and\nis strictly informational in nature.
