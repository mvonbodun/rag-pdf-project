### Key Findings from Retrieval Evaluation

#### 1. Parser Comparison: pdfplumber Wins

**pdfplumber advantages:**
- Extracted **220 blocks** vs PyMuPDF's **119 blocks** (+85% more content)
- Better handling of complex layouts, tables, and multi-column text
- More consistent text extraction across different PDF structures

**Why this matters:** More complete content extraction means the retrieval system has access to all relevant information, directly improving recall.

#### 2. Chunk Size Analysis: 512 Tokens Optimal

**Performance by chunk size:**
- **512 tokens:** 91.7% recall (best semantic cohesion)
- **256 tokens:** 61-72% recall (balanced but suboptimal)
- **128 tokens:** 58-86% recall (fragmented context)

**Why 512 won:**
- Captures complete semantic units (paragraphs, concepts)
- Reduces context fragmentation
- Better alignment with question complexity
- Still fits comfortably in LLM context window (K=5 → 2,560 tokens)

#### 3. Overlap Strategy: 25% Ratio

All winning configurations used **128-token overlap with 512-token chunks (25% ratio)**:
- Preserves context at chunk boundaries
- Captures information spanning multiple paragraphs
- Minimal redundancy while maximizing coverage

#### 4. Embedding Model Comparison

**Performance at cs512 + pdfplumber:**
- **ada-002:** 91.7% recall, lowest cost ($0.0001/1K tokens)
- **openai-large:** 91.7% recall, 2x cost ($0.00013/1K tokens)
- **openai-small:** 83.3% recall, similar cost to ada-002

**Winner: ada-002**
- Tied for best recall
- Best cost/performance ratio
- Proven reliability and stability

#### 5. Performance by Question Type

Using best config (pdfplumber + cs512 + ada-002):

| Question Type | Count | Recall@5 | Analysis |
|---------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Factual** | 5 | 100% | Excellent - direct fact retrieval |
| **Analytical** | 3 | 100% | Strong - captures reasoning context |
| **Boundary** | 2 | 100% | Perfect - overlap strategy works |
| **Multi-hop** | 2 | 50% | Challenging - requires multiple chunks |

**Insight:** Multi-hop questions are the hardest, requiring information synthesis across distant chunks. This is expected and acceptable given 91.7% overall recall.

**Generated Answer:**
> "From FY 2006 to FY 2010, immigration court receipts increased by 12 percent, while completions decreased by four percent. Asylum applications specifically saw a significant decline, with total receipts decreasing by 42 percent and completions by 30 percent during the same period. The leading nationalities for immigration court completions in FY 2010 included Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and China, which represented 67 percent of the total caseload. In FY 2010, 43 percent of aliens whose cases were completed were represented. The grant rate for asylum applications was 51 percent in FY 2010, with a higher grant rate of 61 percent for affirmative applications compared to 35 percent for defensive applications..."
